# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

### Error: "Failed to authenticate"

- **Solution**: Ensure your credentials are correct and properly configured in the configuration file. Refresh the configuration using:
  ```bash
  ksau-go refresh
  ```

### Error: "Network timeout"

- **Solution**: Check your internet connection. If the problem persists, try increasing the timeout settings:
  ```bash
  ksau-go upload --file /path/to/local/file --remote /path/to/remote/folder --timeout 60s
  ```

### Error: "Insufficient storage"

- **Solution**: Verify your OneDrive storage quota using:
  ```bash
  ksau-go quota
  ```
  Free up space or upgrade your storage plan if necessary.

## Configuration Issues

### Issue: "Configuration file not found"

- **Solution**: Ensure the configuration file is located in the correct directory:
  - Linux/macOS: `$HOME/.ksau/.conf/rclone.conf`
  - Windows: `%AppData%\ksau\.conf\rclone.conf`

### Issue: "Invalid configuration format"

- **Solution**: Verify the configuration file format and ensure all required fields are correctly filled.

## Network-Related Problems

### Problem: "Unable to connect to OneDrive"

- **Solution**: Check your network connection and firewall settings. Ensure that OneDrive's endpoints are not blocked.

### Problem: "Slow upload speeds"

- **Solution**: Optimize your network settings and try uploading during off-peak hours. You can also adjust the chunk size for uploads:

  ```bash
  ksau-go upload --file /path/to/local/file --remote /path/to/remote/folder --chunk-size 10485760
  ```

  > Note: It's best if chunk size is multiple of 320KiB as that is what Microsoft's docs told us to use. However it does
  > not cause the API to error out. That said, we still highly recommend using a value that is a multiple of 320KiB.
